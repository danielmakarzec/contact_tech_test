Holding and working with large databases creates a need to filter them based on certain criteria â€“ for example, the location they're based in.

The program accepts two inputs:

-   A JSON array of talent, containing objects with `name`, `location` and `date_of_birth` attributes
-   A location to filter by

The program reads the JSON file, filters its data, and outputs the names of talent whose location matches the location supplied.

---
**For example, given:**

-   The following JSON data:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Homer Simpson",
    "location": "Springfield",
    "date_of_birth": "1956-05-12"
  },
  {
    "name": "Frank Reynolds",
    "location": "Philidelphia",
    "date_of_birth": "1944-11-17"
  },
  {
    "name": "Diane Nguyen",
    "location": "Los Angeles",
    "date_of_birth": "1980-03-19"
  },
  {
    "name": "Krusty the Clown",
    "location": "SpringField",
    "date_of_birth": "1957-10-29"
  }
]

```

-   A location of `Springfield`

The app will output:

```bash
Homer Simpson
Krusty the Clown
```
